## Some things you should know: ##

  * In spite of the standard Chrome permission warnings you may see when you install this extension, this extension does not track or keep any records related to websites you may visit.

  * As more companies adopt the industry privacy standards (http://www.aboutads.info/), their opt-outs will be automatically added to Keep My Opt-Outs. As with all Chrome extensions, you’ll be asked to allow Chrome to update the extension.

  * Once you install Keep My Opt-Outs, your experience of online ads will change: You may see the same ads repeatedly, or see ads that are less relevant to you.

  * You can confirm that your opt-outs have been set at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/
